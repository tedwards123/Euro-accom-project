# My First Personal Project - Accomodation in Europe Analysis

This is my first personal project after university and I feel like I need to get my own work out into the data science/analysis community. There will be lots to pick apart but I 
am keen to use this as a really good opportunity to learn from the community. My first project is motivated by my passion for analysis as well as all my friends going to Europe. 
This project, as seen in the title, is based off a data source obtained from Kaggle which contains information on accomodation in Europe. My goal was to figure out if there were 
any relationships between rating and price as well as some others. Without the guidlines of a university assignment, this was more challenging than i first though but I learnt a 
lot from it. This is one of many to come and I am proud of myself for making a start and making my way into the community.
