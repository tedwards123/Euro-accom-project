# My First Personal Project - Accomodation in Europe Analysis with Abstract

This is my first personal project after university and I feel like I need to get my own work out into the data science/analysis community. There will be lots to pick apart but I 
am keen to use this as a really good opportunity to learn from the community. My first project is motivated by my passion for analysis as well as all my friends going to Europe. 
This project, as seen in the title, is based off a data source obtained from Kaggle which contains information on accomodation in Europe. My goal was to figure out if there were 
any relationships between rating and price as well as some others with the secondary goal of improving my coding and analytical skills. Without the guidlines of a university 
assignment, this was more challenging than I first though but I learnt a lot from it. This is one of many to come and I am proud of myself for making a start and making my way 
into the community. 


# Abstract
This report delved into the relationship between price and customer rating of different accommodation across different countries and websites, from a Kaggle dataset. I was able to find evidence towards a relationship between rating and price. What I hypothesised was that the higher the rating, the higher the price a customer would pay. During the linear regression analysis, there wasn’t much proof of a positive linear relationship, however once I grouped the ratings into categories, we could see that original hypothesis come to light. The prices are in USD. The results were, from cheapest to expensive (Rating Groups):
1.	Rating 2-6
a.	Median: $87; Mean: $108.33
2.	Rating 6-8
a.	Median: $125; Mean: $146.04
3.	Rating 8-10
a.	Median: $146; Mean: $181.07

Using Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn’s post-hoc test, I was able to successfully identify this pattern. Statistically significant results tell us that the groups are all different and I was able to order them. There will be more details in the report but essentially, I found that there was a relationship between rating and price.
